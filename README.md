# Seinfeld - An App About Nothing

## Why Seinfeld?
Seinfeld is a React application about nothing. It is simply a recipe app that does nothing substantial. This is a long-running project that will demonstrate how to use:
- Typescript
- Hooks
- React Router DOM
- Redux Toolkit and Redux Saga
- Refs
- Higher-order components
- Testing with Jest and Enzyme<br><br>

## How Seinfeld

Choose a directory into which you will clone the Seinfeld repository.
1. `git clone https://github.com/scottlurowist/seinfeld.git`
2. `cd seinfeld`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start` &nbsp; in order to start the app
5. `npm run test`&nbsp; in order to run the Jest/Enzyme tests.<br><br>

## What Seinfeld

Hooks seems to be the direction into which React is heading, so this project will be biased towards using hooks. But there will be class-based components to demonstrate their use as well.
